  <h3>Overview
    <span style="float: right"><a href="#top">&#9650;</a></span>
  </h3>
  <p>In Lexatron, a match consists of two <em>players</em>, two <em>letter racks</em>, a <em>letter bag</em>,
  and the <i>board</i> which consists of <i>spaces</i> on which <i>letters</i> may be placed to form <i>words</i>.
  The first player has <em>green</em> letters while the second player has <em>orange</em> letters.</p>

  </center>

  <p>Each player's letter rack consists of up to 7 letters chosen randomly from the
  letter bag. </p>

  <a name="gameplay"></a>
  <h3>Gameplay
    <span style="float: right"><a href="#top">&#9650;</a></span>
  </h3>

  <p>
  Each player takes a turn until the match ends.
  A player may do any of the following to take a turn:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>take one or more letters from their letter rack and place them on the board to form one or more words</li>
    <li>pass their turn</li>
    <li>resign the match</li>
    <li>swap one or more letters from their letter rack with replacement letters selected at random from the letter bag</li>
  </ul>

  <p>On a player's first placement of letters on the board, one of the letters must
  be placed on the player's <em>start space</em>.  The first player's start space is the
  top-left space, and is green with an arrow on it.  The second player's
  start space is the bottom-left space, and is orange with an arrow on it.</p>

    <img src="HelpStartEnd.png" width="275px" />
  </center>

  <p>Thereafter, one of the words formed in a turn must include a letter
  from a word formed earlier by the same player.</p>

  <p>Words extend horizontally and vertically just like in other word games.
  In Lexatron however, horizontally means "diagonally up to the right" while
  vertically means "diagonally down and to the right". That means words formed
  on the board must be read in either the left to right direction or up to down
  direction.</p>

  <center>
    <img src="HelpDirection.png" width="224px" />
  </center>

  <p>Words can of course overlap your other words already on the board.</p>

  <center>
    <img src="HelpOverlap.png" width="225px" />
  </center>

  <p>Words formed do not take into account the letters of words already formed by the opponent. While it is
  possible to form a word with a letter adjacent to an opponent's letters,
  it is not possible to form a word that spans a word of the opponent.
  For example, in the following screenshot, the orange word ZIT is independent of
  the green word PREY. That is, the (invalid) words IPIG and WAITR are not considered.

  <a name="objectives"></a>
  <h3>Objectives
    <span style="float: right"><a href="#top">&#9650;</a></span>
  </h3>

  <p>A player's primary objective in Lexatron is to reach their end space before
  their opponent reaches their end space.</p>

  <p>A player's secondary objective is to score as many points as possible. Should
  the players be blocked from reaching their respective end spaces, a match
  may still be won by having the most points when the letter bag is fully
  depleted.</p>

  <a name="swapping"></a>
  <h3>Swapping
    <span style="float: right"><a href="#top">&#9650;</a></span>
  </h3>

  <p>A player may swap or exchange one or more letters from their letter rack.
  After selecting which letters to swap, the player's turn ends.
  There must be at least 7 letters in the letter bag for swapping to be allowed.</p>

  <a name="blanks"></a>
  <h3>Blank Letters
    <span style="float: right"><a href="#top">&#9650;</a></span>
  </h3>

  <p>There are a number of blank letters in the letter bag at the start of a match.
  When placed on the board (or moved around on the board in the same turn), the
  player is prompted to pick a substitute letter to represent the blank.  The
  substitute letter has <i>a point value of 0</i> but of course may be used to form words.</p>

  <a name="scoring"></a>
  <h3>Scoring
    <span style="float: right"><a href="#top">&#9650;</a></span>
  </h3>

  <p>Each letter has an assigned point value.  Each word formed is the sum of the point
  values that comprise the word.</p>

  <p>The scoring of letters and words may be increased by placing letters atop
  <em>modifier spaces</em>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>2L</em> doubles the point value of the letter</li>
    <li><em>3L</em> triples the point value of the letter</li>
    <li><em>2W</em> doubles the point value of the word formed</li>
    <li><em>3W</em> triples the value of the word formed</li>
    <li><em>!</em> is a one-time bonus of 25 points</li>
  </ul>

  <center>
    <img src="HelpMods.png" width="225px" />
  </center>

  <p>Modifiers only take effect during the turn in which they are encountered.  For
  instance, words formed by extending a word that contains a letter atop a 3W
  does not triple the extended word's point value.</p>

  <p>A player earns a 50 bonus points for using all 7 letters in their letter rack
  in a single turn.</p>

  <a name="gameover"></a>
  <h3>Game-over Conditions
    <span style="float: right"><a href="#top">&#9650;</a></span>
  </h3>

  <p>A match ends when any of the following occur:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>a player reaches their end space before their opponent reaches their own end
      space</li>
      <li>a player resigns the match</li>
      <li>both players pass their turns twice consecutively</li>
      <li>no letters remain to replenish player racks and both player racks are empty</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the latter two cases, the winner is the player with more points.</p>

  <a name="dictionary"></a>
  <h3>Dictionary
    <span style="float: right"><a href="#top">&#9650;</a></span>
  </h3>

  <p>Lexatron uses a slightly modified ENABLE1 (Enhanced North American Benchmark Lexicon)
  dictionary as its source of supported words.  Some derogatory words have been removed to
  keep everybody happy; we hope you understand. Please visit the following URL to view Lexatron's
  dictionary:</p>

  <h3>Match Duration
    <span style="float: right"><a href="#top">&#9650;</a></span>
  </h3>

  <p>Online matches may take a while to finish with turns sometimes taking <em>days</em>.
  This is normal.  Start more matches if you'd like!  You can play up to 25
  simultaneous matches.  Don't worry... if your opponent fails to play a turn
  after some time, you will be declared the winner.</p>

  <h3>Letter Distribution
