	<description>
        Lexatron is a word race!  Form words on the X-shaped board to snake a path from one corner of the board to the other.  Reach your star space first and win!  Detonate a bomb to clear a path and keep going if your opponent blocks your way!  Lexatron is easy to learn but forces the player to make tough strategic decisions.
        Lexatron provides an upgrade path for millions of bored "Words with Friends" players.
